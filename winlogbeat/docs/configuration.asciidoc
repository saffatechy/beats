== Configuration Options

Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've read <<winlogbeat-configuration>>.

The Winlogbeat configuration file uses http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax.
The configuration options are described in the following sections:

* <<configuration-winlogbeat-options>>
* <<configuration-output>>
* <<configuration-shipper>>
* <<configuration-logging>>
* <<configuration-run-options>>

[[configuration-winlogbeat-options]]
=== Winlogbeat

The `winlogbeat` section specifies all options that are specific to Winlogbeat.
Most importantly, it contains the list of event logs to monitor.

Here is a sample configuration:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  registry_file: C:/ProgramData/winlogbeat/.winlogbeat.yml
  event_logs:
    - name: Application
      ignore_older: 72h
    - name: Security
    - name: System

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Options

===== registry_file

The name of the file where Winlogbeat stores information that it uses to resume
monitoring after a restart. By default the file is stored as `.winlogbeat.yml`
in the directory where the Beat was started. When you run the process as a
Windows service, it's recommended that you set the value to
`C:/ProgramData/winlogbeat/.winlogbeat.yml`.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  registry_file: C:/ProgramData/winlogbeat/.winlogbeat.yml
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The forward slashes (/) in the path are automatically changed to backslashes
(\) for Windows compatibility. You can use either forward or backslashes. Forward
slashes are easier to work with in YAML because there is no need to escape them.

===== event_logs

A list of entries (called 'dictionaries' in YAML) that specify which event logs to
monitor. Each entry in the list defines an event log to monitor as well as any
information to be associated with the event log (filter, tags, and so on). The
`name` field is the only required field for each event log.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  event_logs:
    - name: Application
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== event_logs.name

The name of the event log to monitor. Each dictionary under `event_logs` must
have a `name` field. You can get a list of available event logs by running
`Get-EventLog *` in PowerShell. Alternatively, you can look at the registry keys
found under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\eventlog`.

===== event_logs.ignore_older

If this option is specified, Winlogbeat filters events that are
older than the specified amount of time. Valid time units are "ns",
"us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". This option is useful when you are
beginning to monitor an event log that contains older records that you would
like to ignore. This field is optional.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  event_logs:
    - name: Application
      ignore_older: 168h
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===== metrics.bindaddress

The hostname and port where the Beat will host an HTTP web service that provides
metrics. This field is optional.

The following example specifies that the metrics service is available at
http://localhost:8128/debug/vars:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
winlogbeat:
  metrics:
    bindaddress: 'localhost:8123'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The metrics are served as a JSON document. The metrics include:

- memory stats
- number of filtered events from each log
- number of published events from each log
- total number of failures while publishing
- total number of filtered events
- total number of successfully published events
- uptime

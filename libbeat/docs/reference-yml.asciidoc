== {beatname_lc}.reference.yml

//REVIEWERS: Right now, I'm referencing the path to the file in the beats repo, but to make sure we don't expose new config options prematurely (for example, for 6.0.1) I'll need to make a copy of the file and put in the docs directory.

The following reference file is available with your {beatname_uc} installation. It
shows all non-deprecated {beatname_uc} options. You can copy from this file and paste
configurations into the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ file to customize it.

ifeval::["{beatname_lc}"!="auditbeat"]

TIP: For rpm and deb, you'll find the reference configuration file at +/etc/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.reference.yml+. Under
Docker, it's located at +/usr/share/{beatname_lc}/{beatname_lc}.reference.yml+. For mac and win,
look in the archive that you just extracted.

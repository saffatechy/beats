== Community Beats

The open source community has been hard at work developing new Beats. You can check
out a few of them here:

[horizontal]
https://github.com/Ingensi/dockerbeat[dockerbeat]:: Reads docker container
statistics and indexes them in Elasticsearch
https://github.com/christiangalsterer/httpbeat[httpbeat]:: Polls multiple HTTP(S) endpoints and sends the data to
Logstash, Elasticsearch. Supports all HTTP methods and proxies.
https://github.com/mrkschan/nginxbeat[nginxbeat]:: Reads status from Nginx
https://github.com/joshuar/pingbeat[pingbeat]:: Sends ICMP pings to a list
of targets and stores the round trip time (RTT) in Elasticsearch
https://github.com/mrkschan/uwsgibeat[uwsgibeat]:: Reads stats from uWSGI
https://github.com/kozlice/phpfpmbeat[phpfpmbeat]:: Reads status from PHP-FPM
